<div class="sectionBio">

    <div style="padding:5px">&nbsp;</div> 
    
    <p>My name is Nicholas Roseth (<a href="https://name-coach.com/nroseth" target="_blank">pronounce</a>), and I serve as visiting assistant professor and coordinator of music education at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. I teach Introduction to Music, Introduction to Music Teaching, Instrumental Methods & Literature, Music for Exceptional Children, Principles of Music Education, Student Teacher Seminar, and Woodwind Methods, among others.</p>
    
    <p>I previously taught instrumental and secondary general music in Colorado, including band, orchestra, jazz band, class piano, class guitar, and STOMP. While teaching in Colorado, I also served as instructional mentor to new teachers in my district. As a doctoral student at Indiana University, I was program coordinator of Young Winds (a pre-college program providing musical instruction to local middle school band students), student teacher supervisor, and associate instructor in instrumental methods. As a visiting assistant professor of music education at Indiana University, I taught undergraduate and graduate courses including Inclusive Participatory Music Practices, Music Teacher Education, College Music Teaching, and Qualitative Research in Music Education. I have received awards for excellence in teaching from the <I>Pennsylvania Music Educators Association Society for Music Teacher Education</i> and from the <i>Education Foundation for the St. Vrain Valley</i>.</p>
   
    <p>My primary research interests include LGBTQ studies, well-being, place and space, and nonverbal behaviors in teaching and learning. I have presented research and pedagogical sessions at regional and national conferences, and I have research published in <i>Research & Issues in Music Education</i>, <i>Journal of Music Teacher Education</i>, and <i>Journal of Research in Music Education</i>.</p>
   
    <p>I hold a Bachelor of Music (BM) degree from Susquehanna University, a Master of Music Education (MME) degree from the University of Colorado Boulder, and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree from Indiana University Bloomington.</p>
